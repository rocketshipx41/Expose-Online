The album is subtitled "Music From A Non-Existent Movie", and easily qualifies as one of his most mysterious, yet introspective works. Originally released in 2001, the album had a small print run, received little notice and no fanfare. Comprised predominantly of performances played on his beloved SynthAxe, Holdsworth delivers a set of stunningly beautiful, emotional tunes.</blockquote>";s:10:"updated_on";s:19:"2013-04-23 14:59:50";s:12:"published_on";s:10:"2013-04-23";s:7:"credits";a:2:{i:1;a:1:{i:2;s:9:"Jon Davis";}i:2;a:0:{}}}i:1;a:10:{s:2:"id";s:3:"369";s:4:"slug";s:19:"richie-havens-rip-2";s:5:"title";s:17:"Richie Havens RIP";s:5:"intro";s:83:"The iconic folk singer who opened the Woodstock festival has died at the age of 72.";s:11:"category_id";s:1:"2";s:10:"image_file";N;s:4:"body";s:196:"Havens recorded more than 30 albums under his own name and worked with a variety of other artists, including Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett.

Being from a country with a rich and diverse culture, the band's music is unique in having an understanding of the rituals of temple music, as well as completely grasping the essence of the rock and psychedelic sounds of less ancient times. Driven by the communication between keys-master Riza Arshad and the exceptional Tohpati on guitar, simakDialog is a melting pot of western classic/jazz/rock and Javanese/Indonesian exotic rhythm/riffs. Join us as simakDialog brings its signature take on progressive music to the United States for the first time.<br /><br />ProgDay is the longest running progressive rock festival in the world. ProgDay 2013 will take place on Saturday, August 31st, and Sunday, September 1st, at Storybook Farm in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
