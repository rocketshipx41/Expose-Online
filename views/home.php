<p>A note from Robert Silverberg:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I've asked Jon Davis to designate this site as the <em>Quasi-Official Robert
      Silverberg Site</em>, a term of my own devising. What I mean by it is that this
      is as close to an official site as I'm ever going to have, because I lack 
      the technical skills to build a site of my own, as well as the time and, 
      I suppose, the energy. And also my temperament is not inclined toward more 
      self-promotion than is absolutely necessary for my professional well-being, 
      and setting up a web site for oneself strikes me as a rather emphatic act 
      of self-promotion. On the other hand, the site as Jon has constructed it 
      contains everything that a proper author site should have, and nothing 
      that it shouldn't. I was immensely pleased to discover it in my on-line 
      wanderings and I continue to enjoy visiting it (as well as to make use 
      of its bibliographical material for my own reference!).</p>

    <p>In short, I'm delighted that Jon's enthusiasm for my work has led him to
      go to so much effort on my behalf. But &mdash; it remains a 
      <q lang="en-us">quasi-official</q> site because it continues to belong to
      Jon. I may be present as a guiding figure in the background, but he and 
      he alone will decide what is to be included. He is free to run negative 
      reviews of my work if the spirit so moves him, although I hope he doesn't
      feel the need to do it often. (I am about as casual about negative 
      criticism as any professional writer ever was &mdash; usually a harsh 
      review goes out of my mind within minutes &mdash; but I will admit to 
      preferring praise.) I will undertake to keep Jon advised of interesting 
      new developments in my career, and I will drop around from time to time 
      to see what people are saying about me in the guestbook, and I may even 
      reply to some of their comments. And perhaps I'll give Jon the opportunity
      to run a few extracts from some upcoming new book or story, if he wants 
      to.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, quasi-official though it may be, this is still Jon's
      Silverberg site, not Robert Silverberg's, and to him should go all 
      applause for its comprehensiveness and elegance of design, as well 
      as all responsibility for anything that I would just as soon not 
      take responsibility for myself.</p>

  <p>A note from Jon Davis, your host:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Robert Silverberg is a writer who constantly amazes me. Since the
      mid-1960s he has produced an incredible body of work. The quote on 
      so many of his book covers (<q lang="en">Where Silverberg goes today,
      the rest of science fiction will go tomorrow!</q> &mdash; Isaac Asimov) 
      is a simple observation based on repeated forays against the edges of 
      the genre. He's won piles of awards, and if he hasn't hit the bestseller
      lists very often, it's not from lack of quality in his work.</p>

    <p>If you're concerned about spoilers, fear not. I almost never give 
      anything away. Of course, when I describe later works in a series, 
      some of the earlier parts may be given away &mdash; can't really help
      that. I prefer to give hints as to what stories are about, with some 
      analysis and commentary on general thematic issues. The in-depth 
      analyses are another exception, and are usually marked with warnings
      if you prefer to wait until after you've read the work in question.</p>
