<h3>What's this all about, anyway ?</h3>

<p>Once there was music. Simple music. Maybe a nursery rhyme or a simple folk
    tune sung by a kind and loving voice. Soon your ears met new music, maybe 
    a classical piece or a fragment of a pop song, a comforting melody that 
    played in your mind the whole day through. The simplicity of youth soon 
    gave way to the anxieties of adolescence; pop music, then perhaps rock 
    &mdash; began to speak more directly to your spirit in turmoil. As time 
    went by, your musical tastes continued to develop driven by a hunger for 
    new ideas, reaching for new horizons, fusing new styles and idioms, 
    breaking down the existing limits and barriers. Then one day you found 
    yourself alone, ignored completely by a music and radio industry firmly 
    set on maintaining popular music at its lowest common denominator, while 
    your wide ranging taste for eclectic musical styles and experimentation 
    find you increasingly disconnected from the musical mainstream. Is this you?</p>

<p>This growth and disconnection is what <strong>Exposé</strong> is all about. 
    Our primary focus is the music that the mainstream ignores; music whose roots 
    seem to have originated somewhere just outside the pop/rock mainstream, but has 
    progressed onwards toward the boundaries of rock, where it meets jazz, classical, 
    folk, avant-garde, electronic and experimental, going well beyond the standard 
    forms into areas of stark and stunning originality. With Exposé, the focus 
    is on the exploration.</p>

<p><strong>Exposé</strong> began modestly in the autumn of '93 as a bi-monthly companion 
    newsletter to the <i>Exposure</i> radio show, which focuses on progressive and 
    experimental rock and its periphery. It grew from sixteen to forty pages 
    within one year, and has since settled out as an eighty page quarterly, 
    packed with information on all the music that matters, and the artists 
    who create it. Our typical issue contains artist profiles, interviews, 
    historical perspectives, and much more. You will find well over two 
    hundred reviews of new releases and selected reissues in each issue, 
    and <strong>Exposé</strong> is the only English language publication that features roundtable 
    reviews of all important new releases &mdash; not just one, but three 
    different perspectives on the same release. Our writers are knowledgeable 
    about music and the history of music, many being musicians themselves, and 
    are among the best in the field, having previously written for
